### WorldScope: Mobile-to-Mobile Live Broadcast 

The goal of this project is to develop an open source clone of Periscope.  Students will build a mobile client and a server that allow a user to stream video and audio live from a mobile phone to their subcribers (listening and watching on their mobile phones).

### Jiku Director 

[Jiku Director](http://liubei.ddns.comp.nus.edu.sg/jiku/jiku-director.html) is an on-going project in School of Computing, that automatically stitch multiple videos of the same event, captured from different angles by different users, together to form a coherent, more interesting, video representation of the event.  This project aims to extent the functionalities and improve the output quality of the software, while reengineering the system using software engineering principles.

### Cloud-Gaming Friendly Game Engine

Current computer games are written to run on game consoles, PCs, and mobile devices.  Cloud gaming, however, runs these computer games on virtual machines on servers somewhere in the cloud.  There is a mismatch between what is needed to run the games in the cloud versus what the game developers assume when they design the game/game engine.  This project aims to re-architect an existing game engine from the ground up to meet the needs of cloud gaming.

### HTML5-based Zoomable Video Streaming Player

A zoomable video player is a video player that allows user to zoom into and pan around the video to view selected in higher resolution and in more details.  The aim of this project is to develop an open source HTML5/Javascript-based video streaming server and player that utilizes websocket and DASH to stream videos for playback on a Javascript/HTML5 player.
