This list of projects will be available here.  New projects will be added.  You can find two samples of what will be offered here.  If you have ideas about what projects you want to do, feel free to propose your own.  You can email your ideas to Wei Tsang at ooiwt@comp.nus.edu.sg.

### WorldScope: Mobile-to-Mobile Live Broadcast 

The goal of this project is to develop an open source clone of Periscope.  Students will build a mobile client and a server that allow a user to stream video and audio live from a mobile phone to their subcribers (listening and watching on their mobile phones).

### Jiku Director 

[Jiku Director](http://liubei.ddns.comp.nus.edu.sg/jiku/jiku-director.html) is an on-going project in School of Computing, that automatically stitch multiple videos of the same event, captured from different angles by different users, together to form a coherent, more interesting, video representation of the event.  This project aims to extent the functionalities and improve the output quality of the software, while reengineering the system using software engineering principles.

### HTML5-based Zoomable Video Streaming Player

A zoomable video player is a video player that allows user to zoom into and pan around the video to view selected in higher resolution and in more details.  The aim of this project is to develop an open source HTML5/Javascript-based video streaming server and player that utilizes websocket and DASH to stream videos for playback on a Javascript/HTML5 player.

### Cloud-Gaming Friendly Game Engine

Current computer games are written to run on game consoles, PCs, and mobile devices.  Cloud gaming, however, runs these computer games on virtual machines on servers somewhere in the cloud.  There is a mismatch between what is needed to run the games in the cloud versus what the game developers assume when they design the game/game engine.  This project aims to re-architect an existing game engine from the ground up to meet the needs of cloud gaming.


### Game Engine with Progressive Content Streaming

The objective of this project is to develop a game engine that supports progressive downloading of game contents (a.k.a file streaming). The team should come up with game engine design and specifications/API for developers of game content/game, implement the design by modifying any existing open source game engine, and develop a common thin client called Gamelet (may be, plug-in for browser), which can download the game contents on demand and allows game play of any game built with the game engine. 
 
### Adaptive Collaborative Rendering Engine for Cloud Games

The objective is to build a rendering engine (or modify an existing engine, e.g. [Moonlight Stream](https://github.com/moonlight-stream)) that offloads part of the rendering task of cloud games to the client.  For example, some frames can be rendered in the server, others in the client, and they will be combined for display.  The engine should be adaptive to the network bandwidth, client resources, and game context. 

### Open Source 3D Object Web Gallery

With advances in 3D printing and 3D scanning technologies, there are increasing number of 3D models that are being put online.  The goal of this project is to develop an open source Web gallery for 3D objects, similar to [SketchFab](www.sketchfab.com) but spots several advanced features for interacting and viewing 3D objects.
