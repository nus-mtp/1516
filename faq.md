## FAQs for Media Technology Project

#### How is CS3283/4 different from CS3201/2 and CS3281/2?

All three pairs of modules aim to train students in software engineering practices.

Teaching and learning in CS3201/2 are more structured.  Every team works on the same predefined project; In CS3281/2 and CS3283/4 students get to work on different projects.  CS3281/2, however, focus on large-scale complex systems development (usually open source projects) and is intense/compressed (CS3281/2 is taken together in one semester).  In CS3283/4, students complete the projects over a longer period of time (over two semesters).

#### How do I register for CS3283/4?

Registration is done outside of MPE/CORS, using this [CS3283/4 registration website](http://mysurvey.nus.edu.sg/EFM/se/543BE5C214A8AD66).

Please make sure that you have no timetable clash for Thursday 4-6pm, which is the lecture slot for CS3283/4 before you register.

#### How do we form team?

CS3283/4 projects must be completed with a team of 4-5 members (strict bound -- with exceptions allowed only for special cases).

If you have already form a team, you can register your team at [the registration website](http://mysurvey.nus.edu.sg/EFM/se/543BE5C214A8AD66).

If you are looking for a team to join, or has a team that lacks members, register at [the same site](http://mysurvey.nus.edu.sg/EFM/se/543BE5C214A8AD66) and I will try to do some matchmaking.

#### Is there a deadline in registering/forming team/selecting projects?

We should settle everything before the first week of semester.  Although the earlier you do it, the better (especially if you need time to find teammates).

#### I am going away for NOC/SEP/ATAP/etc in Semester 2.  What should I do?

One option is to consider completing CS3201/2 instead.  The other is to work in a distributed fashion during the second half of the project (for CS3284).  Remote software team is common in the software industry and you will get a chance to experience and learn about good practices in managing/participating in a distributed team.  

I, however, urge that you choose the remote team option only if the whole team is comfortable with it, and you are sufficiently disciplined to commit time and effort to the project.

#### What if I am going away for NOC/SEP/ATAP/etc in Semester 1.  Can I do the same?

No.  It is much harder for the requirement elicitation and design phases to be done as a distributed team.  You need to be physically present and working as a co-located team for CS3283.

#### How do we choose our projects?

The list of available projects will be published, and you will be able to bid for the projects the week before the semester starts, by indicating your team preferences.  Details will be provided to registered students.
