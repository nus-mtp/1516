### Final Presentation

The dates for final presentation have been shifted forward to 17 November and 18 November, Tuesday and Wednesday, during the reading week.  Your examiners include A/P Leow Wee Kheng, Dr. Anand Bhojan, Dr. Bimlesh Wadhwa, and Dr. Damith Rajapakse.

Since these dates are usually reserved for UROP and FYP presentation, if any of you are going to give your final UROP/FYP presentation this semester, please let me know (even if you do not know your actual presentation time yet).

There will be three sessions, one on 17 November, two on 18 November.  Each session will feature four teams, and last for three hours.  Each team will have 45 minutes to convince the examiners that: (i) you have done enough work, (ii) you know what you are doing, and (iii) you are doing it the right way.  More details will come later.

### Midterm Report

You are suppose to submit a midterm report by 1st October.  

#### Why a midterm report? 

In the past, we have seen great projects suffered in grades due to hastily written final report.  The midterm report is introduced this year to make sure that all teams start thinking about, and start writing, the report early.  The midterm report also (i) gives me an opportunity to provide early feedback to you on the structure of the report, (ii) let you pause and organized the results of your hardwork in the first half of the semester.

#### What should be included in the midterm report?

You can think of the midterm report as a snapshot of an evolving document that will become your final report.  It should contain at least the following sections:

+ Introduction
	+ What is the motivation behind this project?
	+ What is the overall vision or goal of this project?
+ Software Requirement Elicitation
    + What activities did you perform to gather/validate the requirements of your project?  Include the details (e.g., for user survey, you can mention the questions you asked, who the participants of the survey are, what did you find from the survey, etc).  If it gets too long, put the details in the appendix.
+ Software Requirements
    + What are the requirements (functional, non-functional) of the project?
+ Software Architecture and Design
    + What is the architecture of the software you are going to build?  What are the components? how they interact with each other?
	+ What are some major design/implementation decisions that you have made?  How did you come about making those decisions? (you may include the QOC)

#### What makes a good report?

A good report would be something that is well structured, clearly written, and easy to read.  Use figures, tables, cross-references, when necessary.  The content should flow smoothly from one section to another, with connections between chapters and sections.  

The report should NOT be just a concatenation of all your Google Drive documents.  Although what you have written so far will constitute a large chunk of the content, care should still be taken to connect all the dots and link the different sections together.

#### Is the report graded?

No.  I am not assigning a grade to the midterm report specifically.  However, as you are continuously being evaluated, the effort you put into the report will be factored into your CA2 grade.

#### How to submit the report?

You should submit _a single PDF file_ named team-midterm.pdf, where team is the name of your team in CamelCase, in one word, into a <a href="https://ivle.nus.edu.sg/v1/File/Staff/default.aspx?CourseID=91613bf3-f41c-4b03-921f-cd0ef7a63a87&WorkbinID=2976d6d8-d261-4650-a26c-bb9298cf4bd1&FolderID=f0b86357-8671-4b98-966c-255cb94678f8">IVLE workbin</a> that has been created.
