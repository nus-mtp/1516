Happy new year, and welcome back to a new semester!

A few quick announcements:

+ CS3284 will be allocated to you.  You need not do anything.

+ If you are on leave this semester (due to ATAP/NOC/SEP/etc), please let me know.  

+ Just like last semester, I would like your team to meet up for a 5-hour sprint every week.  The sprint starts in Week 1 (next week!) so please work out a common time to meet and let me know before the semester starts so that I can book the rooms.  I understand that you may have to reschedule once the tutorial schedule is finalized.  So having a tentative schedule for the first two weeks before the tutorial starts is fine.  

+ We will have our first lecture next Friday, just to set the expectation for the coming semester.
