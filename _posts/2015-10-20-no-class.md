Things seems to be going well with all the teams I have met so far, so there is no major topic for me to talk this week.  There will be no lecture.

But, I will be stationed in the VC room to answer any questions and offer any technical help that I can give.  I encourage teams to meet up for this two hours to continue your sprint.  

Next week, I will be at Brisbane to attend ACM Multimedia conference.  So there will be no lecture as well.
