Here is the information about what needs to be submitted for your final reports.  As mentioned, these will be extensions of your CS3283 final report, splitted into two, a project report and a developer's guide.  

In general, the project report will be written with the instructor and examiners as target reader.  It should demonstrate that you have followed and learned good software engineering practices in CS3283/4. The developer's guide will be written with a fellow developer who will maintain and further developer your project as target reader, and should provide information your project and code.  

## Project Report

- You need to submit a PDF file, name teamname-proj-report.pdf, into IVLE's workbin, replacing teamname with the name of your team.
- If repeated content in the project report and dev guide is needed, you can cross reference specific sections in the developer's guide.
- The report should contain at least the following:
    - Requirements: What are your project requirements? What has changed in the project requirements, and why?
    - Architecture and Design: What is the software architecture of your project? Why do you design it this way? Has the architecture changed over the project, and why? What are the design decisions that you have to make during the project? (Remember the 4+1 view and QOC)
	- Coding and Testing: How much of the original requirements are implemented? If there is anything unfinished, justify why. 
	- Code Review: How is code review done within your team?
	- Project Planning: How are the requirements/tasks of the project prioritized? How do you estimate the time needed to complete a task in an iteration. Has the time estimation improved over time?
	- Robustness: How is testing done in your project? What is the code coverage? 
	- Usability: How do you evaluate the usability of your project? What are your findings and how do you address it? 
	- Performance: How do you evaluate the performance of your project? What are the bottlenecks found?  how do you reduce the impact of the bottleneck?  How much improvement did you achieve after optimizing the performance?
	- Security: How do you evaluate the security of your project?  What security issues do you find?  How do you address it?

## Developer's Guide

- You need to submit a PDF file, name teamname-dev-guide.pdf, into IVLE's workbin, replacing teamname with the name of your team.
- The report documents the project's motivation/description, software requirements, design, implementation, test cases, coding convention, instructions on how to install/compile/test/run, remaining issues, repository, CI site, etc.
- The target reader is a fellow developer who will maintain and continue the development of your project.
- Any other information that will be helpful to a developer can go into here.
