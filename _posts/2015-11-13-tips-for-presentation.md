The final presentation schedule was posted under [Schedule](http://nus-mtp.github.io/1516/schedule.html) in case you are not aware.  

Here is a reminder of the tips I gave during the last lecture.

* Start with a bang.  Introduce your team and yourself.
* Give a compelling motivation of your project.  If your project aims to solve a problem, explain the problem.
* Give a short demo of your work.  A short 2-3 minutes canned demo (in the form of a video with narration) is best.
* Explain the key features of your solution.  What are the key/unique requirements?
* Explain how you elicit the requirements (survey? interview?) and highlight key findings.
* Show and explain your design and architecture.  Highlight key design decisions.
* Other things you have done: planning, UI evaluation, implementation, code review, testing, continuous intergration, etc, that you think are noteworthy to highlight.  Show evidence of what you have done instead of just saying it.
* End strongly with confidence.
* Prepare some backup slides (anticipate what questions will be asked).  
* Prepare to cut some content if you run out of time.
* Everyone in the team should take turn to present.
