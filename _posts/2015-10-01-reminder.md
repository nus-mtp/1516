* Many teams are meeting in the lecture venue during the lecture slot today.  I will stay in the VC room until 6pm as well.  Any team that wants to discuss with me can look for me there.  I am on Slack for the team (Litmus) who is meeting virtually.

* Peer review is compulsory, and is due October 2, 2015, 2359.

* Midterm report is due the same time (October 2, 2015, 2359). You should submitted a single file in PDF format to [the IVLE workbin](https://ivle.nus.edu.sg/v1/File/Student/default.aspx?CourseID=91613bf3-f41c-4b03-921f-cd0ef7a63a87&WorkbinID=2976d6d8-d261-4650-a26c-bb9298cf4bd1&FolderID=f0b86357-8671-4b98-966c-255cb94678f8) with filename team-midterm.pdf, where team is the name of your team in CamelCase, in one word.
