Hi, welcome to Media Technology Project, a two-semester long 8MC module where you get to practice what you have learnt in CS2103T in a larger scale project.  Here is the [general information about this module](about.html).

I am glad the [team](teams.html) forming and [project](projects.html) assignment worked well for you so far.  Now that we get that settled, there are a few more logistic issues to take care of.

<!-- more -->

* Each team should send me a ``wefie'' of yourselves.  Note that, by definition, a wefie must be taken by one of the member of the teams, while he/she remains in the photo.  Please don't send me a photo taken by someone else!  So, huddle together, stretch your arm, and get a good photo of yourselves.

* Each team should reserve a 5-hour block per week to work on CS3283/4.  There are some contraints:  
    * The 5-hour block should not end after 6pm.  This means you can choose a block of time from 9am-2pm, 10am-3pm, 11am-4pm, 12pm-5pm, or 1pm-6pm. 
	* The block should be during weekday.
    * It is OK if not all team members are there during the 5 hours block (e.g., one can go off for a tutorial, or for lunch, etc.).  But most members should be there most of the time.  
	* Either me or the TA will meet with you at the beginning/end of the 5-hour block.  This is the time where all team members must be present.

* Every team member should have a chance to practice leading/managing the team.  So, every 5-7 weeks (depending on team size), you will rotate among yourselves to be the project manager.  You can determine the rotation order now, or do it when it is time to rotate, but what I need from you now is a project manager that will lead you through the requirement elicitation phase of the project.

* Each team should setup a system for collaboration: collaborative editing, communication, task planning, etc.  You are free to choose your own tools, but some popular tools are [NUS Wiki](http://wiki.nus.edu.sg), [Google Docs](http://docs.google.com), [Asana](http://www.asana.com), [Trello](http://www.trello.com), [Slack](http://www.slack.com).  Please include me as part of your team. 

You should setup a meeting with your project supervisor to start learning about and gathering the requirements about the project.
