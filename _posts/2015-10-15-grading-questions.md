When grading your project at the end of the semester, I will go through the following questions.  You should keep this in mind.

### Requirements
* Are reasonable efforts being put in to elicit and analyze the requirements?
* Are the project requirements correct? valuable? easy to read? design free? attainable? complete? consistent? unambiguous? verifable? atomic?

### Software Design and Architecture
* Are good design principles being followed in the the design and architecture of the system?  (e.g., low coupling? high cohesion?)
    * If a component is swapped out, what needs to be changed?
    * If a user requirement is changed, what needs to be updated?

* Does the team communicate well internally and with external parties
(e.g., minutes, code comments, docs, git commit messages, README.md, installation/setup/compile instructions)?
* Is reasonable worklow being followed?

### Software Implementation
* Is the code correct, chageable, readable, extensible, maintainable?
* Is testing done in parallel with code development?  (unit testing, integration testing, Is the test coverage reasonable?
* Is code review well practiced within the team?

### Software Usability
* Is the prototype usable?
