When grading your project at the end of the semester, I will go through the following questions.  You should keep these in mind.

### Requirements
* Are reasonable efforts being put into eliciting and analyzing the requirements?
* Are the project requirements correct? valuable? easy to read? design free? attainable? complete? consistent? unambiguous? verifable? atomic?

### Software Design and Architecture
* Are good design principles being followed in the the design and architecture of the system?  (e.g., low coupling? high cohesion?)
    * If a component is swapped out, what needs to be changed?
    * If a user requirement is changed, what needs to be updated?
* Is the design decision and choices being clearly articulated and rigorously justified? 
* Are security issues adequately considered and factored into the requirement and design?

### Software Project Management and Team Work
* Is reasonable practice being used to plan for every iteration? 
* Are the tasks reasonably prioritized?
* Does the team communicate well internally and with external parties
(e.g., minutes, code comments, docs, git commit messages, README.md, installation/setup/compile instructions)?
* Is reasonable worklow being followed?

### Software Implementation
* Is the code correct, chageable, readable, extensible, maintainable?
* Is testing done in parallel with code development?  (unit testing, integration testing, Is the test coverage reasonable?
* Does testing cover most of the code written so far?
* Is unit testing and integration testing automated?  
* Is continuos integration being used?
* Is there evidence of code review being well-practiced within the team?
* Is the release at the end of the sprint potentially shippable?

### Software Usability
* Is the prototype usable (i.e., good usability?)
* Is reasonable process being done to evaluate the usability of the project?  (Heuristic evaluation, user study, etc.)

### Project Report
* Is the report complete? Readable? Well structured? Well written? Concise?

### Final Presentation
* Does the presentation clearly convey the goal and scope of the project? 
* Is appropriate demo being shown at appropriate time?
* Does the presentation clearly covey the software development process of the project? 
* Are the key requirements and salient points of the design/architecture being conveyed clearly?
* Do the team answer the questions well?
