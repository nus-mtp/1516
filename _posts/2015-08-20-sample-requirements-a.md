## Functional Requirements

* The user shall be able to register a new account and log in to the system.
* The user shall be able to search the arrival time of trains for a particular station.
* The system should be able to calculate and display the shortest path, and the estimated travel time, from the starting point to the destination point, taking into account the bus/MRT timing and traffic conditions reported by the users at real time.
* The system shall provide voice alert to the user if the train he is trying to catch has left the station.
* The system should be able to collect data on traffic conditions posted by users, and display them on the map of the app. 
* The system should also allow users to rate the accuracy of this information at this point of time, and remove outdated/inaccurate information automatically.
* The user shall be able to know whether a particular bus/MRT or bus stop/MRT station is crowded. The user will be able to look for this information (in form of text or images) in the app.
* The user shall be able to request other users to provide information for them about the crowd information on the relevant bus/MRT or bus stop/MRT station.
* The user shall be able to rate whether a source of information provided by other users is useful or not.
* The user shall be able to provide information about the crowdedness of a place by himself.
* The user shall be able to provide information about the crowdedness of a place upon
 request from other users.
* The system shall have a route tracking function. In this function, each bus stop/MRT station
 is represented by a circle. At the beginning of his travel, all circles in his route are colored red. Once the bus/MRT passes a bus stop/MRT station, the circle representing the bus stop/MRT station will be colored green. Therefore, user can know when to get off the bus/MRT.
* The system shall allow addition of new bus/MRT information, including the routes of the bus/MRT, name and number of the stops/stations through its travel path, the time interval between two consecutive buses/MRTs, the time for earliest/ latest bus/MRT for user who has a unique identity of administrator.
* The system shall allow update of existed data of bus/MRT information, including the routes of the bus/MRT, name and number of the stops/stations through its travel path, the time interval between two consecutive buses/MRTs, the time for earliest/ latest bus/MRT for user who has a unique identity of administrator.
* The system shall allow user who has a unique identity of administrator to browse all the comments/posts in the database from ordinary users, and allow him to delete improper or obsolete comments/posts.
* The system shall allow administrators to check through all accounts of ordinary users, and shall allow administrators to delete malicious accounts or zombie users.

## Non-functional requirements

* **Accessibility** The system should be accessible to as many people as possible. People with weak vision should be accessible to the system with aid of voice guides and notifications.
* **Availability** The system should be available for any time when the bus/MRT system is working.
* **Capacity (current and forecast)**
 Currently, the system should be capable to handle traffic information from all buses and MRTs in Singapore. From the view of long-term development, the following versions might also include information from other cities.
* **Compliance** The use of data and dissemination of traffic information in our system should follow local policies and legislations in Singapore strictly.
* **Extensibility** The system should have a good support for extensions. Improvement of existed functions and addition of new features shall be supported. In the next major version upgrade the system should also include customizations in terms of UI and functions.
* **Maintainability** The maintenance of the system should be simple and straightforward. The database should have elegant structures to increase the maintainability of the system. The system should also have limitations on user’s posts to make maintenance easier.
* **Performance** The system should have a reasonably quick response to user’s operations. The system should have relatively low occupation of device’s CPU and memory.  Additionally, the system should also have an effective method to retrieve online data to shorten the waiting time for users to see the results of their requests.
* **Platform compatibility** This system should be compatible on any of Android Platform 4.x versions.
* **Pricing** This system should be a free application for any Android 4.x devices.
* **Reliability** The system should regularly keep information updated and reliable.
* **Security** The system should have enough protections for user accounts. The system should defend the database from malicious SQL injections and other types of attacks.
* **Stability** The system should keep its stability on Android devices. It should be working without frequent crashes or break-down.
* **Usability by target user community** The system should have a user-friendly UI and be easily used by our target users. The operations and the presentation of information should be simple and neat.
