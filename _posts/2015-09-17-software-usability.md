In this lecture, Jay Chua presents four rules that Wei Tsang has distilled from existing UI/UX design literature: Don't make me think, or work, or wait, or cry.

### Rule 1: Don't Make Me Think

* Give clear, simple, useful, readable message/information/update/feedback to users 
* Guide users on what to do 
* Be consistent with what users expect
* Don't hide things that user may need
* Provide help, inline
* Place items logically (in context, grouped, hierarchically)
* The primary purpose of every page/view should be clear

### Rule 2: Don't Make Me Wait
* Provide visual feedback ASAP
* Tell users to wait (spinning beach ball, progress bar, DING! when done)

### Rule 3: Don't Make Me Work
* Provide shortcut for experts
* Set reasonable defaults
* Make expected actions easy to reach (Fitt's Law)
* Allow direct manipulation

### Rule 4: Don't Make Me Cry
* 4.1. Keep dangerous actions away
* 4.2. Protect users work, always (allow undo, save a copy)
* 4.3. Always provides a way out

### How to Evaluate the UI/UX of Your Project?

#### Quantitative Analysis
* Measure the time taken for the user to complete a task
* Can break down into different components (time to click, time to read, etc)

#### Neilsen's Heuristic 
* 3-5 evaluators consider [the heuristics](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) and apply it to your project, one by one.
* Here is [an example](http://hcibib.org/tcuid/chap-4.html#e6).

#### Think Aloud Protocol 
* Ask a tester to speak out what they are thinking while using your system
* See a [demo video here](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/thinking-aloud-demo-video/)
