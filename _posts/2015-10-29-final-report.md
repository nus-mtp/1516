#### What makes a good report?

A good report would be something that is well structured, clearly written, and easy to read.  Use figures, tables, cross-references, when necessary.  The content should flow smoothly from one section to another, with connections between chapters and sections.  

The report should NOT be just a concatenation of all your Google Drive documents.  Although what you have written so far will constitute a large chunk of the content, care should still be taken to connect all the dots and link the different sections together.

#### Is the report graded?

The final report will be factored into your CA3 grade.

#### How to submit the report?

You should submit _a single PDF file_ named team-final.pdf, where team is the name of your team in CamelCase, in one word, into a <a href="https://ivle.nus.edu.sg/v1/File/Staff/default.aspx?CourseID=91613bf3-f41c-4b03-921f-cd0ef7a63a87&WorkbinID=2976d6d8-d261-4650-a26c-bb9298cf4bd1&FolderID=4c793847-1846-4f3f-81d0-1152c3f70e7f">IVLE workbin</a> that has been created.  You only need to submit one copy of the report per team.
