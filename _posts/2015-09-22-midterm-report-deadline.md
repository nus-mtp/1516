I just realized that I indicated only the week in which you have to submit the report, but not the exact deadline.  

I am setting the deadline for the midterm report to **Friday, 2nd October, 2015, 23:59.**

I won't hold a lecture on 1 October, 2015.  So your team have another two extra hours working together next week.
