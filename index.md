### About CS3283/4 Media Technology Projects (MTP)

#### The Official Blurb

According to the official NUS bulletin, CS3283 and CS3284 are two modules "on the development of media technology systems such as interactive systems, games, retrieval systems, multimedia computing applications, etc. Students will form project teams to work on media technology projects. This first part focuses on the analysis of the user's needs, formulation of the computing requirements of the desired solution that meets the user's needs, design of the systems according to the requirements, implementation of first-cut prototype for evaluation purpose, and evaluation of the design."

#### What CS3283/4 Really Is

This is a module where teams of students get together, hone their software engineering skills, put the computing knowledge learned in the classroom into practice, and build something cool.

### FAQs

#### How is CS3283/4 different from CS3201/2 and CS3281/2?

All three pairs of modules aim to train students in software engineering practices.

Teaching and learning in CS3201/2 are more structured.  Every team works on the same predefined project; In CS3281/2 and CS3283/4 students get to work on different projects.  CS3281/2, however, focus on large-scale complex systems development (usually open source projects) and is intense/compressed (CS3281/2 is taken together in one semester).  In CS3283/4, students complete the projects over a longer period of time (over two semesters).

#### How do I register for CS3283/4?

Please register here: http://mysurvey.nus.edu.sg/EFM/se/543BE5C214A8AD66


#### How do we form team?

CS3283/4 projects must be completed with a team of 4-5 members (strict bound -- with exceptions allowed only for special cases).

If you have already form a team, please register your team at http://mysurvey.nus.edu.sg/EFM/se/543BE5C214A8AD66

If you are looking for a team to join, or has a team that lacks members, register at the same link above http://mysurvey.nus.edu.sg/EFM/se/543BE5C214A8AD66


#### I am going away for NOC/SEP/ATAP/etc in Semester 2.  What should I do?

One option is to consider completing CS3201/2 instead.  The other is to work in a distributed fashion during the second half of the project (for CS3284).  Remote software team is common in the software industry and you will get a chance to experience and learn about good practices in managing/participating in a distributed team.  

I, however, urge that you choose the remote team option only if the whole team is comfortable with it, and you are sufficiently disciplined to commit time and effort to the project.

#### What if I am going away for NOC/SEP/ATAP/etc in Semester 1.  Can I do the same?

No.  It is much harder for the requirement elicitation and design phases to be done as a distributed team.  You need to be physically present and working as a co-located team for CS3283.
